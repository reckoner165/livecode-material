# livecode-material
An archive of code from past live coding performances

Contains code in TidalCycles and a Supercollider setup script. They were written in the comfort of Atom running haskell-mode.

Feel free to fork and use the code samples in your own composition/performance.
NOTE: The code is not well documented. If you would like to understand what is going on here, use the [TidalCycles documentation](https://tidalcycles.org/functions.html) for reference.
